# Explainable AI (XAI)

## Introduction
Explainable AI (XAI) refers to a set of techniques and methods that make the predictions of AI models more interpretable and understandable to humans. As AI systems become more complex, ensuring transparency and trust is crucial, especially in sensitive applications like healthcare, finance, and legal systems.

This repository is dedicated to exploring different XAI techniques and applying them to real-world AI models. Our goal is to bridge the gap between black-box models and human interpretability.

## What This Repository Covers
This project will include:
- **Fundamentals of XAI** â€“ Understanding the need for explainability and different types of explanations.
- **Model-Agnostic XAI Techniques** â€“ Methods like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) that work across various models.
- **Intrinsic XAI Methods** â€“ Exploring interpretable models such as Decision Trees and Rule-Based Models.
- **Neural Network Explainability** â€“ Techniques like Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients, and Saliency Maps to interpret deep learning models.
- **Applications** â€“ Implementing XAI in real-world use cases such as image classification, NLP, and structured data.
